								Recent psychological evidence suggests that humans run simulation
								of 3D objects in their minds as part of the reasoning process. Can we create
								a program to do the same? The IMS project seeks to answer that question.
								In cooperation with Eric Bigelow, Alex Wilson, and Dr. Lenhart Schubert,
								we have developed a 3D reasoning specialist for EPILOG that does
								just this. This project is written in python, and uses Blender for 3D
								modeling. 
                                <!-- It will be the basis for my undergraduate thesis, to be written this spring. A draft of the paper can be found <a href="docs/3DNLP.pdf">here</a>. <br/> -->

							<p>
								Can humans work together to complete a task without communicating? Can AI agents
								for that matter? Can the two work together? The Predator vs Prey, and its 
								derivative, Shape Tester, attempt to answer this question. In PvP, teams
								of predators try to catch teams of mice, and in Shape Tester, predator agents
								try and form a shape to simulate cornering a prey. Experiments are currently
								researching the efficacy of human, AI, and mixed teams. 
								This project was done in tandem with Carnegie-Mellon's Dr. Jeffrey Bigham,
								Walter Lasecki, and Mitchell Gordon along with ROCHCI's 
								<a href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/hci/pastprojects.php?proj=lgn">Legion</a> project. 
								The report can be viewed <a href="docs/shapeTesterReport.pdf">here</a>.

								Once again harnessing the power of the crowd, <a href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/hci/pastprojects.php?proj=ch">Chorus</a>
								uses the reasoning of a group of online volunteers to solve tasks, My
								particular work has focused on the topic saver, which uses machine learning and natural language
								processing algorithms to store previously discussed topics for future consideration
								by the crowd. This project is donw in cooperation with Carnegie-Mellon's Dr. Jeffrey 
								Bigham, Walter Lasecki, and Yongke Yu.

								On the lighter side of research and development, I teamed up with University of Rochester's hacking
								club, <a href="http://www.rochack.org">RocHack</a>, to create this light-hearted, though still intriguing, project.
                                Do online talk shows sound formulaic to you? Do you find yourself playing bingo with the things 
								that pundits say over the radio or on TV? If so, you may need a job. 
                                In any case, we aim to show that anyone can be a political pundit, even a hacked-together AI! 
								Enter Opinion_Bot. Using n-gram markov chains and a database of text, it can formulate and spit 
								back opinions it learned from data. </br>
                                Our two existing bots, RUSH_LIMBOT and MICHAEL_BLOOMBOT, are fed copious text from Rush Limbaugh's 
								radio show transcripts and MSNBC opinion articles respectively, and our debate tournament script has 
								them take turns arguing with one another. As they debate, they add each other's rebuttals to their 
								knowledge base, which enables them to gradually argue about the same topic. Just like real pundits, however,
								they will never change their opinions on these topics! Created for HackNY Spring 
								2014, this project won "Best Command-Line Interface." The code can be viewed on my 
								<a href="https://github.com/scarafoni/Auto_Pundit">github</a>, and the description can be viewed 
								on <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/spring-2014-hackny-student-hackathon/hacks/automated-punditry">hackerleague</a>
